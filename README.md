Decision Making and Recursion Tasks

# Overview

This repository contains implementations of various programming tasks focusing on decision-making (using if-else and switch statements) and recursion. Each task demonstrates fundamental concepts in JavaScript programming.

# Tasks Included

1. Decision Making

   - Leap Year Checker :
     A function that takes a year as input and determines whether it is a leap year or not. Leap years are defined as those divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless they are also divisible by 400.

   - Ticket Pricing
     A program that prompts the user to enter their age and determines the price of a movie ticket based on age criteria:
     Children (age <= 12): $10
     Teenagers (age 13-17): $15
     Adults (age >= 18): $20

   - Weather Clothing Adviser
     A program that asks the user for the current temperature and whether it is raining. Based on this information, it advises the user on appropriate clothing.

2. Recursion

   - Fibonacci Sequence
     A recursive function to generate the nth Fibonacci number, where the sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

   - Palindrome Checker
     A recursive function that checks if a given string is a palindrome, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

   - Power Function
     A recursive function that calculates the result of raising a number to a given power.
